I think it was fascinating to see and process his reaction and handling of a terminal diagnosis like that. I think making jokes and looking back on his past in good ways is an amazing thing to be able to do in his situation and really shows how important that attitude in life can be. His focus on others is a great way to look at the world and is something I certainly agree with. Helping others is one of the most important things you can do not just for the world but for yourself as well. Building connections and handling the world with respect and care will genuinely help you work through your life too. There are of course many times where you need to focus on yourself and that is okay, during those times it is so much better to have those connections and care for the world around you as it can truly help you even when you feel at your worst for yourself.
