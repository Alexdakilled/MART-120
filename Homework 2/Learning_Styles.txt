I believe the idea of learning styles in this way is a very generalized idea. The way we learn is a lot more complicated than 3 extremely basic categories. This does not mean that learning styles should be ignored or that they are not important, instead I believe that much more is at play than just whether the information is coming from our ears or eyes. With a much more expanded view learning styles play an extremely important role in how we optimize and develop our learning. Many people learn much better when a group social aspect is at play, while others prefer a solitary environment. Others work better when taught directly while some prefer online separation. There are many more examples and differences that shape how we best learn and it's important to categorize and recognize in ourselves which methods work best for us. Sometimes there can even be differences in learning styles based on what subject is actually being explored, this adds an even deeper layer to how we learn and develop efficiently.
