A GUI can offer much easier and universal access to a program and its functions, while a CLI offers faster and simpler usage but often takes much more knowledge and understanding to use efficiently. A GUI uses images and menus to convey to the user what is going on, when developed well it can allow for many people to grasp the concept of how the program is operating immediately. A GUI allows for infinite possibilities for interfacing with a program such as buttons and sliders. For example, file explorer in windows uses a GUI to give the user drop down folders and different view modes for easy navigation through a file system. A CLI is very different, and is often not used or preferred by most people. A CLI’s only form of interfacing is through text inputted commands by a user. It can allow for much less confusing navigation, as you simply need to just tell the computer what to do. However, each program has different commands and modes when using the command line, this essentially requires the user to have a decent amount of specific knowledge for exactly what program they are using to get any efficiency out of CLI at all. This often increases confusion and time as most of the user’s time is spent figuring out what command to use and remembering how exactly to format it. However, once mastered, the command line can often become much faster and efficient to use if commands and actions are memorized.
